    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Nammu';


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Namratha';

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Namratha';
    console.log("team2 " + team2 + " players " + players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Namratha';
    console.log("team3 " + team3 + " players " + players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Namratha';
    console.log("team4 " + team4 + " players " + players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 100 });
    console.log("captain2 ");
    console.log(captain2);
    console.log("person ");
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const obj = {
      l1k1: 1,
      l1k2: {
        l2k1: 'hey',

    console.log("obj2");
    console.log(obj2);
    console.log("obj");
    console.log(obj);

    // Instead, we can
    const obj3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
    obj3.l1k1 = 3;
    obj3.l1k2.l2k1 = 'Hej!!';
